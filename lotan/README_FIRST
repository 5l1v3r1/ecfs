SYNOPSIS - Extended core file snapshot technology-

The $CWD contains the source code for the ./ecfs program
which is the primary component. This program is invoked by
the kernel (through /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern) to transform
core files into ecfs files. 

The ecfs_api directory contains a library (still in the works)
that makes parsing ecfs files very easy.

INSTALL -

To build ecfs type:
make

* Then as root run (not sudo) *
./setup.sh

After this, you should observe that when a program crashes it creates
an ECFS file in /opt/ecfs/cores/<some_file>.pid

These files are of type ET_NONE so that objdump can read the section
headers, but if you want to use the file as a core file mark it as
ET_CORE before using with GDB.
