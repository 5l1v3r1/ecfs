Extended Core File Snapshot - ECFS - INSTALL file

 INSTALL
-----------
To install this program, you must have libelf and libdwarf installed--
and if you are on x86_64 you must have both the 32bit and 64bit versions
of these development libraries.

On Debian/Ubuntu based distros do `apt-get install libelf-dev libelf-dev:i386`
For other distros either use your distros package manager or compile from source.
Libdwarf sources are located at http://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html
Libelf sources are located at http://www.mr511.de/software/ (site in German, but README's in English)

- [INSTALL -

The following are instructions on building and installing the ecfs-core dump software suite.
Which includes not only the ecfs-core functionality itself, but also libecfs (For developers
to parse ecfs-core files) and the readecfs utility (Similar to readelf). 

(For Linux x86_64)
Dependecies:
(Note: deps/libdwarf32.a and deps/libdwarf64.a can be used)
apt-get install libelf-dev libelf-dev:i386 libdwarf-dev

To build and install ecfs type:
sudo ./setup.sh 
sudo make install

OR 

make V=prod B=32
make V=prod B=64
sudo make install


The 'make install' will put custom line into /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern 
that tells it to invoke /opt/ecfs/bin/ecfs_handler during a coredump.

(For Linux x86_32)

For the 32bit systems we don't need ecfs_handler (Which invokes either a 32bit
or 64bit ./ecfs worker process). Only 32bit processes will be handled so
we can use the ./ecfs binary directly (Without ecfs_handler). Follow these
instructions:

Dependencies:
apt-get install libelf-dev libdwarf-dev

To build and install ecfs type:
sudo ./setup32.sh
