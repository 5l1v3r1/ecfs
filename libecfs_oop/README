[ ECFS API / libecfs]

libecfs is the library that is used to parse the ecfs file format.
It is designed in such a way that parsing this extended ELF format
is done with minimal effort. 

Use cases:

Malware analysis of ecfs files
Advanced debugging of ecfs files
Writing a tool like readelf (Maybe called readecfs)

See man libecfs (in ../manual/man.txt)
