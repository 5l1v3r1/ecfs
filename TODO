-- Difficult issues

A.1. Fix heuristics.c so that code injection detection from 
false positives. This detects shared libraries that were
injected in some way other than dlopen() and LD_PRELOAD.
probably with mmap() or __libc_dlopen_mode() or ptrace
shellcode. 

A.2. Currently in libecfs when retrieving the GOT info there
are GOT entries that are filled with addresses other than
what we guessed should be there by looking at the PLT and
symbol table. Even if there is no shared library injection
we get mismatched addresses in our GOT info code in libecfs
this must be fixed. 

A.3. Currently some injected objects (SHT_INJECTED) such as when
an ET_REL has been found in the process. We create a section
header that only covers the text of that object, and not the
data segment. This is especially important for injected executables
or shared objects, since often we want to extract these for
analysis after the fact.

-- Medium issues

B.4. Add code to readecfs so that it builds section headers on extracted
objects 'with readecfs -O' option. 

B.5. Enhance SHT_INJECTION so that when it detects ELF objects (in core_accessors.c)
that it also marks the data segment as INJECTED.


-- Easy

C.1 Add feature to readecfs so that in the -g option it prints out the relocation
name that is associated with each listed GOT entry.

C.2. Fix libecfs bug where it adds a base to the pltVaddr resulting in an incorrect
address
