- [SYNOPSIS - Extended core file snapshot technology-

The $CWD contains the source code for the ./ecfs program
which is the primary component. This program is invoked by
the kernel (through /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern) to transform
core files into ecfs files. 

The ecfs_api directory contains a library (still in the works)
that makes parsing ecfs files very easy.

- [INSTALL -

Dependecies:
apt-get install libelf-dev libdwarf-dev

To build ecfs type:
make

* Then as root run (not sudo) *
./setup.sh

XXX NOTE XXX:
If you see '-t' being passed to ecfs in setup.sh this means that it
will write the entire text segment of each shared library (vs. just
the first 4k). ecfs ALWAYS writes the entire text segment of the executable
but limits the text of each shlib to only 4k unless you specify -t.
Which means opts.text_all is set in ecfs.c. Having -t set will cause
ecfs to take much longer as it has to write out sometimes hundreds of 
megabytes of code segments.

After this, you should observe that when a program crashes it creates
an ECFS file in /opt/ecfs/cores/<some_file>.pid

These files are of type ET_NONE so that objdump can read the section
headers, but if you want to use the file as a core file mark it as
ET_CORE before using with GDB.

After a reboot you will have to run setup.sh again if you don't echo
the following line into one of two files:

(For systemd based systems like arch Linux)

/usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-coredump.conf


(For ubuntu and other systems that don't use systemd)

/etc/sysctl.conf


The line you want to echo into one of the files above:

kernel.core_pattern=|/opt/ecfs/bin/ecfs -i -e %e -p %p -o /opt/ecfs/cores/%e.%p

(For example):

echo '|/opt/ecfs/bin/ecfs -i -e %e -p %p -o /opt/ecfs/cores/%e.%p >> /etc/sysctl.conf'

- [ECFS LOGGING/DEBUGGING -

Debug output is logged using syslog() and can be found in either /var/log/syslog or
on some systems such as arch Linux you will need to look at 'journalctl -b'

- [ECFS HEURISTICS -

ecfs can perform heuristics that do things such as mark shared libraries as being DLL injected.
Sometimes false positives can arise. If you want to use the heuristics feature use the -h switch.
For instance:

echo '|/opt/ecfs/bin/ecfs -i -h -e %e -p %p -o /opt/ecfs/cores/%e.%p >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
